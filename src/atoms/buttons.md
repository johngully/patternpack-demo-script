## Buttons
There are two forms of buttons used in the application.  Primary buttons should
be used for submitting form or other explicit calls to action.  Secondary buttons
should be used for any other action beyond the primary call to action.

### Examples
<div class="library__example">
  <button type="submit">Primary</button>
  <button type="button">Secondary</button>
</div>

### Code
```html
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```
